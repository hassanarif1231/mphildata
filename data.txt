To develop and evaluate the Real-Time Car Parking Occupancy Prediction System, a diverse and representative set of datasets is crucial. The data collection process involves obtaining parking lot images from various sources, each showcasing distinct visual conditions and environmental scenarios. The data collection process follows a series of steps:

Several publicly available parking lot occupancy datasets are considered for this research, each with its strengths and limitations. The selection involves identifying datasets encompassing a wide range of visual conditions, weather scenarios, and occlusions to ensure system robustness and generalization ability. The chosen datasets include:

PKLot: This dataset contains 12,417 images captured under different weather conditions. It is limited by minimal occlusions due to camera positioning.

ACMPS: With around 13,126 images captured from four viewpoints during the daytime, ACMPS offers a moderate number of occlusions and weather variations similar to PKLot.

CNRPark: This dataset provides a closer view of parked cars, includes labels for various weather conditions, and presents extra occlusions between cars and other objects.

ACPDS: Despite being the smallest dataset, ACPDS offers a high number of unique viewpoints and visual categories. It introduces challenges due to perspective distortions from wide-angle camera setups.

SPKL: This dataset, collected by the research team, addresses the lack of wintertime images in existing datasets, featuring 440 images with varying snow conditions.

The extracted images and corresponding labels from each dataset are collected and standardized. Annotations of parking lots from different datasets are converted into a unified format, verified for consistency and accuracy, and then split into training, validation, and testing sets.

To increase the diversity of training data, image augmentation techniques are applied, including rotation, flipping, resizing, and brightness adjustments.

To address specific visual conditions not well-represented in existing datasets, labels associated with each dataset are extended up to 11 categories, accommodating scenarios like fog, night, and glare.

The selected object detection algorithm is EfficientNet-B03, chosen for its lightweight and efficient performance. The architecture is customized with depth-wise convolutions, swish activation, and squeeze & excitation subblocks. Transfer learning is applied to fine-tune the architecture for parking occupancy detection using the collected datasets.

The training phase involves loading preprocessed datasets, creating data loaders for efficient training, and training the EfficientNet-B03 model on the training set using binary cross-entropy as the loss function. Hyperparameter tuning explores learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization techniques.

The integration of location awareness involves creating 3D representations of parking environments using available location data (e.g., GPS coordinates). Location-based slot allocation optimizes parking slots based on real-time occupancy predictions and available parking spaces.

The development of an Intelligent Parking Manager Agent employs reinforcement learning techniques, utilizing algorithms like Deep Q-Network (DQN) for real-time adaptation to changing parking patterns and dynamic slot reallocation.

A user-friendly mobile application is designed with an intuitive interface, allowing users to interact with the system, view real-time parking availability, and receive notifications about their allocated slots and penalties. The mobile application is integrated with the Real-Time Car Parking Occupancy Prediction System to provide real-time updates.

Performance evaluation involves assessing the model's accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve on validation and test datasets. System evaluation evaluates the overall performance of the Real-Time Car Parking Occupancy Prediction System in improving illumination, optimizing parking allocation, and enhancing cost efficiency.

The results are analyzed and interpreted to draw conclusions about the system's efficacy, taking into consideration data analysis techniques, ethical considerations, validity, reliability, and the research timeline.
